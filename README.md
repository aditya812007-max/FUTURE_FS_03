# 🚄 IRCTC Reimagined: The Future of Rail Travel

> **Task 3: Rebrand a Famous Brand’s Website Using AI**
> *Future Interns Full Stack Web Development Internship*

## 🌟 Project Overview
This project is a modern, AI-powered reimaging of the **IRCTC (Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation)** booking platform. 

The goal was to take one of the most high-traffic, complex utility sites in India and transform it into a seamless, futuristic user experience using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Generative AI**.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router), React.js
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (Animations)
- **AI Tools Used:** - **Adobe Firefly:** Generated the holographic train assets and logo concepts.
  - **ChatGPT:** Generated the modern color palette and marketing copy.
- **Backend (Planned):** Firebase (Auth & Database)

## ✨ Key Features
- **Futuristic UI:** A clean, "Glassmorphism" design that replaces the cluttered legacy interface.
- **AI-Powered Route Suggestions:** (Concept) Smart recommendations based on travel history.
- **Instant Seat Availability:** Visual representation of seat maps (replaces the text-heavy tables).
- **Dark/Light Mode:** Seamless theme switching for night-time booking.

## 🎨 Design Decisions (AI-Assisted)
- **Primary Color:** `#2563eb` (Electric Blue) - Represents trust and technology.
- **Accent Color:** `#f97316` (Sunset Orange) - A nod to the original Indian Railways branding but modernized.
- **Typography:** `Inter` & `Rajdhani` (for that high-tech transport feel).
